# Project Summary
The project is a full-stack web application designed to help users track their habits and monitor career progress through a job aggregator. It allows users to create custom habits, mark them as complete, view their progress, and receive job notifications based on their preferences. The application is built with a focus on modular design, making it easy for beginner developers to understand and extend.

# Project Module Description
- **Habit Tracker**: Users can add, edit, and delete habits, track daily completions, and visualize progress.
- **Job Board**: Users can browse job listings, filter by various criteria, and apply for jobs directly through external links.
- **Data Export**: Users can export their habit data in Excel or CSV formats for personal tracking.
