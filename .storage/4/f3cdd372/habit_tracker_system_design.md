# Habit Tracker & Job Aggregator System Design

## Implementation Approach

After analyzing the requirements, I've designed a modular system that prioritizes the MVP features while ensuring scalability for future enhancements. The system will use a modern React frontend with Tailwind CSS for styling, and a Node.js/Express backend for the job scraping service.

### Key Implementation Decisions:

1. **Frontend Framework**: React.js with functional components and hooks for state management. This provides a component-based architecture that's maintainable and extensible.

2. **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling that supports the clean, modern design requirements.

3. **State Management**: 
   - For MVP: React Context API for global state and localStorage for persistence
   - Future expansion: Potentially Redux for more complex state management when implementing Pro features

4. **Backend Architecture**: 
   - Express.js RESTful API for job data
   - Microservice architecture with separate services for job scraping, future user authentication, and notifications
   - Node-cron for scheduled job scraping

5. **Data Storage**:
   - MVP: LocalStorage for user data and JSON files for scraped job data
   - Future: SQLite for structured data as features expand

6. **Export Functionality**: SheetJS (xlsx) for exporting habit tracking data to Excel/CSV

### Technical Challenges & Solutions:

1. **Job Scraping Reliability**:
   - Implementation of retry mechanisms and error handling
   - Use of proxy rotation if needed to avoid IP bans
   - Unique job identification to avoid duplicates

2. **Data Persistence**:
   - Structured localStorage data with versioning for future migrations
   - Regular data backup to prevent loss

3. **Scalability Path**:
   - Design patterns that allow for easy transition from localStorage to server-based storage
   - API endpoints that can handle authentication in future iterations

## Data Structures and Interfaces

The system's data structures are designed to support all MVP features while allowing extensibility for future features. Refer to the class diagram for detailed structure.

## Program Call Flow

The sequence diagrams illustrate the main user flows and system processes, showing how components interact during key operations.

## Anything UNCLEAR

1. **Job Portal Sources**: The specific job portals to scrape are not specified. The system will be designed with a configurable scraper that can be adapted to various job sites.

2. **Export Format Details**: The specific fields and format for data exports are not fully specified. The initial implementation will export all habit data with timestamps and completion status.

3. **Habit Types**: The system is designed to handle generic habit tracking, but specific habit types or templates aren't defined. The initial implementation will support free-form habit creation with daily completion tracking.
