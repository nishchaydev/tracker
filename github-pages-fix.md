# GitHub Pages Deployment Fix

## ✅ Fixed Issues:
1. **Branch Trigger**: Updated workflow to trigger on `main` branch (was `master`)
2. **Workflow Pushed**: The corrected workflow is now in your repository

## 🔧 One More Step - Enable Permissions:

You need to enable write permissions for GitHub Actions:

1. **Go to Repository Settings:**
   - Visit: https://github.com/nishchaydev/tracker/settings

2. **Navigate to Actions:**
   - Click on "Actions" in the left sidebar
   - Then click on "General"

3. **Enable Workflow Permissions:**
   - Scroll down to "Workflow permissions"
   - Select **"Read and write permissions"**
   - Check the box for **"Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"**
   - Click **"Save"**

4. **Re-run the Workflow:**
   - Go to the "Actions" tab
   - Click on the failed workflow
   - Click "Re-run all jobs"

## 🚀 After This:
- The workflow should run successfully
- Your site will be live at: https://nishchaydev.github.io/tracker
- Future pushes will automatically deploy

## 🔍 What Was Wrong:
- The workflow was set to trigger on `master` branch
- But we're using `main` branch
- GitHub Actions needs write permissions to deploy to Pages

This should fix the deployment issue! 🎉
